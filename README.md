# CAREAI

CAREAI is an intelligent conversational assistant designed and built using **Voiceflow**, a no-code platform for creating voice and chat experiences. It helps users by providing responsive, natural language interactions tailored to support care-related tasks and inquiries.
 🚀 Project Overview

CAREAI leverages Voiceflow’s powerful drag-and-drop interface to create an interactive AI assistant that can:

- Understand and respond to user queries using natural language
- Provide helpful information or guidance based on care contexts
- Seamlessly handle multi-turn conversations without coding
- Integrate with various voice platforms (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Web Chat)

This project showcases how no-code tools can empower rapid AI prototype development without traditional programming.
